# Recipe

*Recipe* is an mvc application that manages food recipes.

## Business Case

Food Recipes are usually stored on notes and sometimes are lost and forgotten. A solution is needed for preserving this recipe for the future generation.
We need an application that is going to provide everyone the posibility to add recipes.

## Technology

Recipe is using the following technologies:

- Java [version: 8] (the language used to write the application)
- Maven [version: 3.6] (the tool for managing dependencies and building the project)
- Liquibase [version: 3.8.7] (for managing the database changes)
- H2 Database [version: 1.4.200] (for providing a relational database)
- Spring-Boot [version: 2.2.5.RELEASE] (the framework for creating spring application that just run)
- Spring-Boot-Data-JPA [version: 2.2.5.RELEASE] (the dependency for easier access and manipulation of relational database)
- Spring-Boot-Thymeleaf [version: 2.3.0 Release] (the Java template engine for both web and standalone environments)
